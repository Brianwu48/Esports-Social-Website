# Esports-Social-Website

Senior Project

The goal is to create a website designed to help centralize the Esports' Club workload and automate tasks related to the Esports Club. Doing so will efficiently and reliably process daily tasks and give up to date information to the council of the club that help with effective decision making.


Languages and Tools  
-HTML  
-CSS  
-JavaScript  
-Firebase (Database)  

Goals and functions  
-Basic Login and Account info  
-Automate member registration  
-Calendar and schedule planning displayed from database  
-Forum posting to allow communication and news to all members  
-Have a database to keep track of members and other important data (Events, meeting dates, deadlines)  
-Uniform team registrations  
-Organize and centralize information  

Unfortunately due to time constraints, only half of these goals were achieved. The website is still in its beta stages.  
The website was briefly launched for demostration purposes.
